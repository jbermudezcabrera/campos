Welcome to |name|
====================

|name| helps you to quickly create and generate fully functional forms.
Read a bit more about it or jump to `User's Guide`_

Main features
-------------

- Good integration
    You can use |name|' fields and forms like normal Qt objects anytime you
    want in your existing gui code like.

- Dynamic generation
    Just pass a source object to :func:`campos.get_forms` method and |name|
    will give you two nice ready to use forms.

- Simplified API
    Use |name|' fields as building blocks to create your forms.

- Works with major Qt bindings
    Thanks to |qtpy| you just need to set ``os.environ['QT_API']``
    before you use |name| if you have a favorite Qt binding, one of the
    existing ones will be used otherwise.
